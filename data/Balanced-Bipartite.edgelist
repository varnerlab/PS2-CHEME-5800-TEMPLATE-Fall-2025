# Edge file for Balanced Bipartite Graph
# Record: source, target, cost, lb capacity, ub capacity
# source: 1 = source node, 2,3,4 = people nodes, 5,6,7 = job nodes, 8,9,10 = sink nodes
# wij: cost of assigning person i to job j. If negative, faculty i prefers course j, 0 indicates no preference, 
# positive indicates dislike.
